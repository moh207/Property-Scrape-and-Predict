# Property-Scrape-and-Predict
This project involves web scraping property listings from OLX, integrating data into a structured dataframe, and extracting meaningful features, including TF-IDF scores and key property attributes. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the potential for machine learning applications in property analysis.

n this data science project, I conducted an end-to-end analysis of real estate data by web scraping property listings from OLX. After collecting the listings, I organized them into a structured dataframe, where I carried out extensive data preprocessing to standardize and clean various property attributes. I then engineered valuable features from the property descriptions using TF-IDF, a common NLP technique for quantifying text relevance. Additionally, I extracted key numerical features, such as the number of rooms and land area, which are crucial indicators of property value and suitability. The project highlights the complete workflow, from data extraction to feature engineering, and sets the foundation for further exploratory analysis or predictive modeling to understand trends in the real estate market.

There is still lots of room for improvement, and the project could be replicated to extract other items and categories on OLX Dubizzle
